    "# Google Gemini 2.0 Browser Demo \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Google Gemini 2.0 with `browser-use` to automate real browser interactions. Browser Use provides a powerful yet simple interface that enables AI to control your browser, making websites accessible for AI agents. Key features include direct browser control (navigate, click, interact with elements), complex workflow automation (multi-step tasks), and real-world applications like writing in Google Docs, automated job applications, flight searches, and data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document Management: Write documents in Google Docs, save files in different formats (PDF, etc.), organize and manage content\n",
    "- Job Search Automation: Parse CVs and match with job listings, bulk apply to relevant positions, open applications in multiple tabs\n",
    "- Travel Planning: Search flights across platforms, compare prices and options, track travel deals\n",
    "- Data Collection: Scrape and analyze web content, save structured data to files, sort and filter information\n",
    "\n",

    "Learn more about Browser Use capabilities at [Browser Use Documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/introduction). Browser use, uses the Playwright library and LangChain under the hood."
